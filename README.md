# 🌟 Kaggle Competition: Spaceship Titanic

---
## 📖 Introduction
- **Author**: Quan Hoang Ngoc  
- **Inspiration**: Kaggle Competition after Completing Andrew Ng's ML Courses  
- **Date**: Summer 2023

### 📚 About
This repository hosts my inaugural self-practice project on Kaggle, inspired by the foundational teachings of [Professor Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). The aim of this project is to participate in the [Spaceship Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) and to apply the machine learning skills acquired through the course.

### 🤔 What is it?
This project involves predicting which passengers survived the Spaceship Titanic disaster. Utilizing various machine learning techniques, I analyze data to develop and evaluate models, ultimately contributing to a competitive ranking on Kaggle.

### 🎯 Why do we do it?
Engaging in Kaggle competitions allows practitioners to:
- Apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets and challenges.
- Enhance data analysis and model-building skills.
- Benchmark skills against a global community of data scientists.
